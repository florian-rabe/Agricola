# Agricola Solo Game Checker

## Overview

The main part of this repository is my implementation of Agricola logic, which I use to check my solo games.
If you enjoy treating the Agricola solo game as a puzzle in which you have to find a way to maximize your points, it can be more convenient to "play" a game by programming the sequence of moves.
That allows the tool to verify the game and give an overview that allows finding optimization potential.
It also makes it easy to play small variants of the same game over and over to find the perfect strategy.


## License

3-clause BSD license with the additional requirement that you may only use in a way that respects the property rights of the creator, owner, publisher etc. of Agricola.
In particular, you may only run the code if you own a physical copy of the Agricola game.
